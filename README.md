# MolSim
Simulating Hydrocarbon Dynamics With Consistent Force Field Method

We developed a program to simulate the dynamics of hydrocarbon molecules using the consistent force field method devised by Shneior Lifson and Arieh Warshel.

mol_display.py produces the CSV files used to create graphs and animations of the molecule dynamics.

mol_notebook.ipynb converts these CSV files to readable graphs, some of which were used in our paper linked below.

mol_simulation.py reads these CSV files and renders them with VPython, which we screen-recorded and have posted on YouTube, also linked below.
